My name is Álvaro Granados, I am from Spain but currently I am based in Cork, Ireland. I have been living in Ireland for the last 8 years.

Right now, I am finishing a Level 6 Certificate of Professional Training (High Level) Diploma in Cross Platform App Development. (Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma, DAM). This is just the beginning so join me in my developer learning journey.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Django), Java (Spring/Hibernate), Kotlin, SQL, data base management, data structures.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with people that can be my mentor on projects that allow me to enhance my abilities.
